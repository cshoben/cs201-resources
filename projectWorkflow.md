# Project Workflow
This guide will walk you through how to complete Java assignments/projects in Compsci 201 by using P0: Person201 as an example. Before starting, you should have installed all the necessary software (Java Liberica JDK, Git Bash, Visual Studio Code) as explained in this guide.

TODO DANIEL: ADD IN LINK ABOVE.

**NOTE**: If you wish, you may also follow these instructions in [video format](#video-links) under the videos "Mac_Cloning_Project/Windows_Cloning_Project" and "Mac_Project_Workflow"/"Windows_Project_Workflow."

TODO DANIEL: ADD IN PROPER VIDEO LINKS ONCE CREATED!

## Overview of Visual Studio Code

The official introduction to VS Code can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs). In particular, the following links should be useful in getting to know VS Code!
- [User Interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface)
- [Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)
- [Introductory Videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos)

Upon installing VS Code, you'll be greeted with a launch screen like this:



For this course, you'll mainly be using "Open" to open folders containing code related to projects.

Unlike some other IDEs, VS Code works with folders, not "VS Code projects." Any folder/directory that exists on your computer can be opened in VS Code with File > Open. For this course, you’ll work with folders that each store a collection of related Java files

## Step 0: Creating all

These instructions are copied over from the installation guide.

## Step 1: 

NOTE to people reading this, I'm largely referring to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dlEwDwiIyEQFxXOHS_zY-Qojx4djl4p2Ud16qpeb7gY/edit#) AND this script (I would say we're currently at Step 2 of the document/ Clone SSH link on the following guide):

REVISED Project Workflow
Prior to Recording
- Make sure the folder you're storing stuff in matches the project structure in installingSoftware.md
- VSCode is a fresh copy without the Duke CS201 plugin installed
- Liberica is installed - any version > 11 will work
Cloning from GitLab
- Remind students that this video assumes you've set up an SSH key
- Show how to fork from GitLab page
- Clone SSH link
- Open up command line and navigate to the proper place
- Clone with command line and open folder in VS Code
- Show optional method: Open in your IDE -> Visual Studio Code (SSH)
- REMEMBER you have to make a new folder where you'll store in the repo files
Project Workflow
- Remind students that this video assumes that you have Liberica installed AND the previous instructions have been followed
- Show that VSCode is not recognizing Java
- Install Raj’s plugin
- Make one single change in the project (and make sure to save since it’s VSCode!!!!)
- Run through the trinity of Git commands
- Refresh the GitLab page and show that the change actually transferred over
- Show optional method: Use VSCode -> Source Control.
- Make another commit, stage commits, commit, and push (remember check mark is commit, all other commands are hidden elsewhere)
